# Dangerous Dave Replica

- This project is a replica of the 1988 DOS game Dangerous Dave, made by John Romero. The project was build in Python along with a team of three students (Arthur Medeiros, Guilherme Cattani and me), as a course assignment.
- The goal of the project was to study and practice the three types of programming paradigms: imperative, object-oriented and functional. To achieve this, we picked Python as a language since it can perform all three types of tasks in a fairly good way.

## Running the program

- To compile the program, you must have Python 3 installed.
- Some packages (mainly `pygame`) may need to be installed using `pip` before starting the program.
- You can run either of the main python scripts located at the root of the repository: `python main_oo.py` or `python main_fun.py`. This should start the game immediately. However, only main_fun.py has been instrumented to send data to  New Relic.

## Misc

- The project is almost a identical replica - the only thing that wasn't implemented was the enemies, due to the project's deadline.
